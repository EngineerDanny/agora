    This tutorial enables you to quickly get started in your development efforts to create an Android app with real-time video calls, voice calls, and interactive broadcasting.
    
    With this sample app, you can:
    - Join and leave a channel.
    - Mute and unmute audio.
    - Enable or disable video.
    - Choose between the front or rear camera.

    A more complete demo can be found [here](https://github.com/AgoraIO/Basic-Video-Call/tree/master/Group-Video/OpenVideoCall-Android).

Prerequisites:
  - Android Studio 3.3 or above
  - Android device (e.g. Nexus 5X). A real device is recommended because some simulators have missing functionality or lack the performance necessary to run the sample.

          <string name="agora_app_id"><#YOUR APP ID#></string>
          <!-- Obtain a temp Access Token at https://dashboard.agora.io -->
          <!-- You will need to deploy your own token server for production release -->
          <!-- Leave this value empty if Security keys/Token is not enabled for your project -->
          <string name="agora_access_token"><#YOUR TOKEN#></string>
          ```
